## ClimbAx.co.uk

Climbax is an automated training aid for climbers. It uses two lightweight bands containing movement sensors that are worn on the wrists that collect data about your climbing. Our validated algorithms detect climbing and individual moves and track all sorts of other stats about your performance. After your training session you simply upload the data from the bands to our website, which automatically produces a report for you that you can view on your profile.
